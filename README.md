patunnel
========

This is a small sailfish app to load a PulseAudio tunnel sink and move audio streams between sinks.

For the non-geeks this means that you can send the audio from any app to your Linux PC over WiFi. The Jolla can do this out of the box, but it needs do be done on the terminal, which is a little inconvenient ;-)
